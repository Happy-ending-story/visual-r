# Introduction of visual-r
## How to use
- First, users can perform regression analysis using the lm code in R before using this tool.
- At this point, in R, you must use `model <- lm` for regression analysis code; other codes such as `df <- lm` will not be recognized.
- Clicking the green button at the top of this tool copies code that extracts data suitable for visualization. Running this code in R extracts the data.
- Now, simply upload the extracted data file to the input field at the bottom to proceed with visualization.

## How to run
```powershell
pip install -r requirments.txt
